tips to working with git and github

Name: Prateek Oberoi  


My field of study: oh god it's awful  


Three main activities:   
  1.  Planning workshops for kiddies
  2.  Learning web dev junk
  3.  Learning about psych experiments so I can run unsuspecting students through them and get all up in their heads about it  
  
  
Three main strats: 
  1.  Plan stuff out at the beginning of the day  
  2.  Do stuff as soon as you think about it  
  3.  Relax and have fun
